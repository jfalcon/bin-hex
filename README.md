# Learning Binary and Hexadecimal

_A beginner's guide to talking like a computer._

If you have been programming for either a few months or a few years, chances are you have come across the terms **binary** (bin for short) and **hexadecimal** (hex for short) at some point in your career. For the programmers that have begun their careers in the years of late a thorough understanding of these enigmatic topics are typically known only to well-seasoned programmers. In contrast, some of the older, more experienced programmers were shown this to be a fundamental concept when programming for computers just to get their job done.

This shift in thought results in less programmers learning binary and hex nowadays. And so, this document aims to remedy the situation by providing a introductory explanation of how binary and hexadecimal work. It is only a rudimentary text but will allow the reader to pursue a further understanding once completed.
